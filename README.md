# Robot Directory
An exercise in CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) programming, explored via an interactive website that allows the user to create new robots and edit and delete their existing robots.

Utilizes SQLite3 for its database, Bootstrap for CSS, and ERB for it's views (HAML is used for the dashboard, as an additional exercise).

## Usage
In the terminal, from the root folder of the project (`robot_world`), run `shotgun`.

In your web browser, navigate to `localhost:9393`. Buttons will guide your navigation and creation, viewing, and editing of robots in the directory (database).
